                Crypto services are flashier and more user-friendly than ever, but few understand what goes on under the hood. The DERP tool from HOPR duplicates the functionality of a typical RPC provider, but it makes explicit the sheer amount of identifying data these services expose. As youâ€™ll see, this happens as soon as you connect your wallet, and all without you needing to make a transaction.

                Add the DERP RPC endpoint to your crypto wallet to see exactly what information is being leaked about you every time you connect to a crypto service.
